# ble-volume-knob

This code is built on ai thinker **esp32 board** with _bluetooth_. 

It uses the **BLE** protocol to send HID commands and it works surely on android and windows (only windows 10 tested)

You might need a ble device connecting app if the device isnt showing on your phone's bluetooth device list.

If you have any issues report them on the issues page!!!!
